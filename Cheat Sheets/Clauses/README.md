## Files in this folder

1. **[WHERE](where.md) 📍** 
    * Filter rows based on specific conditions.  
2. **[GROUP BY](group-by.md) 📊** 
    * Group rows with the same values and use aggregate functions.  
3. **[HAVING](having.md) 🛠️** 
    * Filter groups after aggregation (used with `GROUP BY`).  
4. **[ORDER BY](order-by.md) ⬆️⬇️** 
    * Sort query results in ascending or descending order.  
5. **[DISTINCT](distinct.md) ✨** 
    * Remove duplicate rows from the result set.  
6. **[BETWEEN, IN, LIKE](between-in-like.md) 🔍** 
    * Filter rows using ranges, lists, or patterns.

## Quick Tips
- Combine clauses for more **powerful queries** (e.g., `WHERE` + `GROUP BY` + `HAVING`).  
- Use **parentheses** to control logical conditions with `AND` / `OR`.  
- Remember the difference between **WHERE** (filters rows before grouping) and **HAVING** (filters after grouping).  
- Use **DISTINCT** carefully to avoid unnecessary performance overhead.
