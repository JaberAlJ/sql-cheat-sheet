## âš¡ Quick Tips

* **Always use `ORDER BY`** when using `FETCH FIRST N ROWS ONLY` to ensure consistent results.
* **Use `DISTINCT` carefully**; it removes duplicates but can slow down queries on large tables.
* **`WHERE` filters rows before aggregation**, while **`HAVING` filters after aggregation**.
* **NULL values** behave differently in comparisons; use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`.
* **Combine multiple conditions** with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` for precise filtering.
* **Aliases (`AS`)** improve readability for calculated columns or renamed outputs.
* **Column positions in ORDER BY** can be used but may reduce query clarity.
